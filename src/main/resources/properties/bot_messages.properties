How does this bot work? 🤔\n\n\
To get started, simply use the command /language and select two languages, one by one. \
After that, feel free to do whatever you like! \
Just type any word or phrase in the chat, and the bot will start looking up the contextual \
translation for you in the chosen language.\n\n\
If you need a different function, just switch the bot to another mode and keep sending it \
your words or messages in the same way. 🌍\n\n\
Here’s a list of available commands:\n\n\
/language – Pick the language pair you’ll be working with for translations or other features! 👌\n\
